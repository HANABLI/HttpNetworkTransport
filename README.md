# HTTPNetworkTransport

This is a library which implements the transport interfaces needed by the Http library, in terms of the network endpoint and connection abstractions provided by the SystemAbstractions library.

## Usage

The `HttpNetworkTranspot::HttpServerNetworkTransport` class is basically an adapter to implement Http::ServerTransportLayer using an underlying
SystemUtils::NetworkEndPoint operating in a connection-oriented mode (e.g. TCP server socket).

The `Http::Client` class is used to send Http request to the web server and parse HTTP responses received back from web server.

## Building the C++ Implementation

A portable library is built which depends only on the C++11 compiler and
standard library, so it should be supported on almost any platform.  The
following are recommended toolchains for popular platforms.

* Windows -- [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/) (Microsoft Visual
  C++)
* Linux -- clang or gcc
* MacOS -- Xcode (clang)

This library is not intended to stand alone.  It is intended to be included in
a larger solution which uses [CMake](https://cmake.org/) to generate the build
system and build applications which will link with the library.

There are two distinct steps in the build process:

1. Generation of the build system, using CMake
2. Compiling, linking, etc., using CMake-compatible toolchain

### Prerequisites

* [CMake](https://cmake.org/) version 3.8 or newer
* C++11 toolchain compatible with CMake for your development platform (e.g.
  [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/) on Windows)

### Build system generation

Generate the build system using [CMake](https://cmake.org/) from the solution
root.  For example:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A "x64" ..
```

### Compiling, linking, etc...

Either use [CMake](https://cmake.org/) or your toolchain's IDE to build.
For [CMake](https://cmake.org/):

```bash
cd build
cmake --build . --config Release
```
